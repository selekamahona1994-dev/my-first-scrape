**Title:** Enhancing Agricultural Knowledge Sharing in Tanzania: A Focus on Communication Channels and Jargon Barriers  

**Problem Statement:**  
The surge in digital information necessitates increased access to knowledge but often fails to translate into actionable agricultural practices due to linguistic barriers. Farmers struggle with understanding jargon, which hinders effective communication and integration of scientific knowledge.

**Theoretical Framework:**  
Applying the SECI Model by Nonaka & Takeuchi, we examine how interpersonal networks facilitate knowledge sharing among farmers through communication. Language jargon emerges as a significant barrier, impairing the externalization of scientific knowledge.  

**Research Questions:**  
1. How do interpersonal networks in Tanzania support the socialization of agricultural knowledge?  
2. What role does language jargon play in hindering the practical application of scientific knowledge in rural settings?  
3. Which communication channels enhance the internalization of agricultural best practices?  

**Methodology:**  
A qualitative case study approach, utilizing semi-structured interviews with local farmers and community leaders in a Tanzanian village, to explore knowledge sharing dynamics and linguistic challenges.

**Conclusion:**  
This proposal explores enhancing agricultural knowledge sharing in Tanzania through improved communication methods. By addressing language barriers and leveraging interpersonal networks, we aim to bridge gaps in knowledge integration, fostering sustainable agricultural practices and better public health outcomes.
